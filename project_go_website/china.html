        <h1>The Game of Go: Culture & History</h1>
        <h3>
          Go is a type of strategic board game played with a gridded board and
          black and white stones. It originated in China and was known by
          various names such as "yi," "qi," and "shuotan" in ancient China,
          constituting one of the Four Arts alongside music, chess, and
          calligraphy.

          The Chinese Chess Academy
        </h3>
        <p>
          On March 15, 1992, the inauguration ceremony of the Chinese Chess
          Academy was held with great solemnity. Construction of the Chinese
          Chess Academy began in October 1988 and lasted for over three years
          before its completion. The Chinese Chess Academy is a comprehensive
          training base and competition venue for chess sports in China. It
          operates directly under the National Sports Commission and is
          responsible for managing the national Go, Chinese chess, and
          international chess teams' training tasks. Additionally, it oversees
          various major domestic and international competitions for these three
          types of chess. Furthermore, the academy organizes a wide range of
          recreational chess activities for the general public.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November 2019, the Chess and Card Sports Management Center of the
          General Administration of Sport of China (China Chess Institute) was
          designated as the guardian unit for the national-level intangible
          cultural heritage representative project "Chinese Chess."

          The China Weiqi League A
        </h3>
        <p>
          In its inaugural year, the Chinese Weiqi A League featured only ten
          teams. The competition followed a home-and-away format with 18 matches
          played over two rounds. In subsequent editions, each season of the
          league comprised twelve teams, with a total of 22 matches played over
          two rounds. Each club could field four out of six registered team
          members for participation. The teams were not restricted to players
          affiliated with the Chinese Chess Institute, leading to the presence
          of numerous Korean and Japanese players, including foreign recruits,
          in both the A and B Leagues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting from 2006, there is a championship match between the champion
          of the Chinese Weiqi A League and the champion of the Korean league.
