        <h1>The Game of Go: Culture & History</h1>
        <h3>
          Go is a type of strategic board game played with a gridded board and
          black and white stones. It originated in China and was known by
          various names such as "yi," "qi," and "shuotan" in ancient China,
          constituting one of the Four Arts alongside music, chess, and
          calligraphy.

          The Haifong Go Academy
        </h3>
        <p>
          Mr. Lin Wenbo, in the year 1997, due to his passion for Go, decided to
          donate thirty million NT dollars to establish a foundation with the
          aim of promoting Go. After consulting with professional Go player Lin
          Haifeng and receiving his full support, Mr. Lin agreed to serve as the
          first chairman of the foundation. Thus, the "Haifeng Cultural and
          Educational Foundation" was established, embarking on the mission of
          promoting Go. As organizing both professional and amateur competitions
          requires a significant amount of funds and manpower, the Haifeng
          Foundation has long been supported financially by Chairman Lin Wenbo.
          Despite growing rapidly, there was still a perceived shortage in
          organizing professional competitions, prompting the need for
          organizational adjustments. Chairman Lin decided to merge the "Haifeng
          Cultural and Educational Foundation" into the "Peisen Cultural and
          Educational Foundation" to maximize efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Peisen Cultural and Educational Foundation, another charitable
          foundation supported by Chairman Lin Wenbo and his family, has been
          engaged in special education work. Due to its ample financial
          resources compared to the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation,
          the decision was made to merge the two entities. Following the merger,
          the Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation gracefully stepped
          down, passing the baton of promoting Go to the Peisen Cultural and
          Educational Foundation. In response to the needs of Go promotion, the
          staff of the former Haifeng Cultural and Educational Foundation
          underwent adjustments and reorganized into the "Haifeng Go Academy,"
          continuing to engage in the forefront of promoting Go.
