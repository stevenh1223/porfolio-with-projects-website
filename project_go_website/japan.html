          Go is a type of strategic board game played with a gridded board and
          black and white stones. It originated in China and was known by
          various names such as "yi," "qi," and "shuotan" in ancient China,
          constituting one of the Four Arts alongside music, chess, and
          calligraphy.

              The Nihon Ki-in (Japanese: 一般公益法人日本棋院, Ippankōekihōjin
              Nihon kiin) is the largest Go organization in Japan, responsible
              for managing various Go tournaments. Its headquarters is located
              in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, with additional branch offices in Nagoya
              and Osaka, serving as central and Kansai headquarters
              respectively. Currently, the Nihon Ki-in oversees approximately
              300 Go players.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Nihon Ki-in was established in 1924 through the merger of the
              two largest Go organizations at the time, Honinbo Mon and
              Hogensha, with the support of Okura Kishichiro. After its
              establishment, the Nihon Ki-in faced competition from other
              organizations and individuals such as Shigematsu Shigeo, Wu
              Qingyuan (Go Seigen), and Weiqi Shinsha. In 1950, a group of Go
              players led by Hashimoto Utaro broke away from the Nihon Ki-in and
              founded the Kansai Ki-in, establishing their own organization in
              the Kansai region.
            </p>
            <p>The affiliated organizations include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Tokyo Main Office</li>
              <li>Kansai Headquarters</li>

            <h3>The Nihon Ki-in Title Matches</h3>
            <p>
              The seven major Go tournaments in Japan, ranked by prize money,
              are Kisei, Meijin, Honinbo, Oza, Tengen, Gosei, and Judan. Among
              these, the top three tournaments in terms of prize money, Kisei,
              Meijin, and Honinbo, are collectively known as the "Three Major
              Title Matches." Among them, the Kisei is the highest title. If a
              player concurrently holds all three titles, they are referred to
              as achieving the "Big Triple Crown."
            </p>
            <p>
              The most significant feature of the seven major Go tournaments is
              that all Go players have the opportunity to participate. However,
              the methods for determining challengers vary. In the Meijin and
              Honinbo tournaments, players enter a preliminary round before
              advancing to the league stage. Entering the league stage is a
              testament to a player's status as a top-tier Go player.
            </p>
            <p>The prize money for the title matches is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kisei: 45,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Judan: 7,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Honinbo: 28,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Gosei: 8,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Meijin: 30,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Oza: 14,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>Tengen: 13,000,000 Japanese Yen</li>
