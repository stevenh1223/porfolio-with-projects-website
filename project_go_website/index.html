        <h3>
          Go is a type of strategic board game played with a gridded board and
          black and white stones. It originated in China and was known by
          various names such as "yi," "qi," and "shuotan" in ancient China,
          constituting one of the Four Arts alongside music, chess, and
          calligraphy.

        <h3>Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          According to legend, Go was invented around 2300 BC by Emperor Yao.
          His son, Danzhu, was proud and arrogant, prone to fits of anger and
          stubbornness. In order to temper his son's temperament, Emperor Yao
          invented Go.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the game of Go, there are two types of stones, black and white. It
          is a rule that the player who holds the black stones makes the first
          move. Both players then take turns placing their stones on the
          intersections of the lines of a 19x19 grid board. Once a stone is
          placed, it cannot be moved, and players are not allowed to take back
          their moves. During the game, players aim to surround territory and
          capture opponent's stones. The winner is determined by the total area
          surrounded, or "territory", on the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules of Go are concise and elegant, yet the gameplay is
          infinitely varied. Mastery of its intricacies requires extensive
          practice and study. Chess grandmaster Emanuel Lasker praised it,
          saying, "If there are intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe,
          almost certainly they play Go." At the same time, Go is considered one
          of the most complex board games in the world. Its complexity was
          proven to be PSPACE-hard by Robertson and Munro in 1978.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of mid-2008, there were over 40 million Go players worldwide, with
          the vast majority located in East Asia. By the end of 2020, the
          International Go Federation had a total of 77 member countries and 5
          association members.
        </p>

        <h3>Modern Go:</h3>
        <p>
          After the Meiji Restoration, Go players lost support from the
          shogunate and began seeking new means of livelihood, leading to the
          emergence of newspaper Go matches and the modern ranking system, and
          the establishment of the national Japan Go Association. In the Showa
          era, Go players Wu Qingyuan and Kitani Minoru jointly ushered in the
          trend of the "new opening," marking the beginning of modern Go.
          Subsequently, top-tier Go players emerged in the Japanese Go world,
          such as Sakata Eio, Fujisawa Hideyuki, Takagawa Kaku, and later, Otake
          Hideo, Ishida Yoshio, Takeuchi Michio, Kobayashi Koichi, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1989, Korean player Cho Hun-hyun won the inaugural Ing Cup World Go
          Championship, sparking a surge of interest in Go in Korea.
          Subsequently, numerous world Go tournaments emerged. Among these
          tournaments, Korean player Lee Chang-ho emerged as the dominant figure
          in the Go world at that time. After 2006, Lee Chang-ho's performance
          declined somewhat, and new forces such as Lee Se-dol and Gu Li began
          to challenge him. The following years saw a period of rivalry between
          Gu Li and Lee Se-dol.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 2010s, numerous Chinese Go players emerged prominently on the
          international stage. Players like Ke Jie, Fan Tingyu, Shi Yue, Mi
          Yuting, Chen Yao Ye, Zhou Ruiyang, and Tan Xiao, among others,
          consecutively won world championship titles.
        </p>

        <h3>Culture:</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout its millennia-long transmission, Go has gradually developed
          numerous terms. Some of these have entered mainstream vocabulary, such
          as "endgame." Nearly every move in Go is associated with a specific
          term, to the extent that one can vividly describe a local battle
          entirely in writing. For instance: "Black occupies the upper right
          corner's star point, White makes a small knight's move, Black makes a
          two-space high pincer, White makes a one-space approach move, Black
          follows with another approach move, White makes a small knight's move
          into the corner, Black blocks at the 3-3 point..." This passage
          vividly describes a common opening sequence using Go terminology.
        </p>
        <p>Common terms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "Calling for capture": When a stone has only one liberty, it is
            called "calling for capture."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Liberty": A liberty refers to an empty intersection point on the
            board that is adjacent to a stone. A single stone can have no more
            than four liberties, but a group of connected stones may have more
            than four liberties. When placing a stone threatens the liberties of
            opponent's stones, it's referred to as "tightening liberties" or
            "squeezing liberties."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Capture": A stone with no liberties is captured and removed from
            the board. Capturing opponent's stones in this way is referred to as
            "capture."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Eye": On the board, an empty intersection point surrounded by
            stones of one player is called an "eye."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Territory": The sum of the number of eyes surrounded by living
            groups and the living groups themselves is referred to as
            "territory."
          </li>
          <li>"Empty space": The area enclosed by stones on the board.</li>
          <li>
            "Ko": A situation where both players can take turns capturing each
            other's stones. In the rules of Go, when a ko occurs, the player
            whose stone has been captured cannot directly recapture it but must
            first find a ko threat elsewhere, allowing them to recapture after
            their opponent responds to the threat.
          </li>
