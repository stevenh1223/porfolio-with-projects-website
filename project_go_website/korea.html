        <h3>
          Go is a type of strategic board game played with a gridded board and
          black and white stones. It originated in China and was known by
          various names such as "yi," "qi," and "shuotan" in ancient China,
          constituting one of the Four Arts alongside music, chess, and
          calligraphy.

          The Korea Baduk Association (Korean: 한국기원) is the governing body
          for professional Go in South Korea, with its origins tracing back to
          the founding of the Hancheng Go Institute by Cho Namchul in November
          1945.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1937, Cho Namchul went to Japan to study under the ninth-dan Go
          player Kitani Minoru. He returned to Korea in 1945 and established the
          Go Institute. Traditionally, Koreans used the "Xunjiang" opening
          strategy, but after the establishment of the Korea Baduk Association,
          Cho persuaded Koreans to adopt the "Bai Ban" opening strategy. In
          1956, he founded the National Handicap Go Championship, popularizing
          Go competitions among the general public.

        <div class="player">
          <h4>Cho Namchul</h4>
          <h5>
            Cho Namchul (Korean: 조남철, November 30, 1923 – July 2, 2006), was
            a South Korean professional Go player of the ninth dan rank, widely
            regarded as the father of modern Go in Korea.
          </h5>
          <p>
            In 1946, Cho Namchul founded the Hancheng Go Institute, marking the
            official establishment of professional Go in South Korea. In 1950,
            under Cho Namchul's organization, South Korea held its first modern
            Go ranking tournament, with Cho being ranked as 3-dan and others
            being ranked as 1-dan. In 1955, Cho persuaded South Korean President
            Lee Seungman to organize a delegation of professional Go players to
            Taiwan, where they engaged in international matches against local Go
            players and emerged victorious. This victory lifted the spirits of
            the South Korean people and brought Cho and modern Go to prominence.
            Soon after, professional Go tournaments were established in South
            Korea, and the Hancheng Go Institute was rebuilt in 1968, renamed as
            the Korea Baduk Association. Cho himself dominated the South Korean
            Go scene for many years after the 1950s until his influence waned
            upon the return of his junior, Go player Kim In. He was awarded the
            rank of 9-dan in 1983 and in 1994, at an advanced age, he competed
            in the National Go Championship, becoming the oldest player to
            compete in the professional Go tournament. His nephew, Cho Chihyun,
            studied in Japan with his support and later became a prominent
            figure in the Japanese Go community.

          <h4>Cao Xunxuan</h4>
          <h5>
            Cao Xunxuan (Korean: 조훈현, born March 10, 1953) is a renowned Go
            player from South Korea. He holds the rank of professional 9-dan in
            the Korea Baduk Association and has won the World Go Championship
            nine times. Cho is considered one of the founding figures of modern
            Go in South Korea and is revered as the "Emperor of Go."
          </h5>
          <p>
            Cao Xunxuan is the master of Lee Changho, the record holder of the
            World Go Championship. They are known as the "Cao-Lee
            Master-Disciple". Along with Lee Changho, Liu Changhe, and Xu
            Fengzhu, they are collectively referred to as the "Four Heavenly
            Kings of South Korea," dominating the world Go scene from the 1990s
            to the mid-2000s. Cao was born in Mokpo, South Jeolla Province. He
            became a professional Go player at the youngest age in the history
            of the Korea Baduk Association at the age of 9 years and 7 months in
            1962. In 1963, Cao went to Japan to study Go and became a disciple
            of Segoe Kensaku. He re-entered the professional Go ranks in Japan
            and was recognized as a 5-dan by the Nihon Ki-in in 1972. However,
            he returned to Korea due to his military service and developed a
            close friendship with the famous amateur Go player and South Korea's
            gambling king, Cha Minsu, during his military service. After
            completing his military service, Cao originally planned to return to
            Japan, but he chose to stay in Korea after facing intense
            competition from Xu Fengzhu. Cao emerged victorious in the
            years-long rivalry with Xu Fengzhu and became the dominant figure in
            the South Korean Go scene. He won over 130 domestic Go championships
            in South Korea and was promoted to 9-dan in 1982. In 1989, Cao
            defeated Nie Weiping, the Chinese Go master, 3-2 in the first Ing
            Cup competition, winning the championship and igniting a Go craze in
            South Korea, becoming a national hero.

        <div class="player">
          <h4>Lee Changho</h4>
          <h5>
            Lee Changho (Korean: 이창호, born July 29, 1975), is a Go player
            born in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, South Korea. He is considered
            the second-generation master of Go in South Korea and is one of the
            greatest Go players in modern Go history, second only to Go Seigen.
            He is often referred to as "In the 20th century, there was Wu
            Qingyuan, and in the 21st century, there is Lee Changho."
          </h5>
          <p>
            In 1986, at the age of 11, Lee Changho achieved professional rank,
            second only to Cao Xunxuan's 9-year-old achievement. In 1992, at the
            age of less than 16 years and 6 months, he won the world
            championship, making him the youngest world Go champion to date. In
            1996, the Korea Baduk Association granted him and Liu Changhe direct
            promotion from 7-dan to 9-dan. Lee has won all domestic
            championships in South Korea and achieved the Grand Slam of world Go
            tournaments. His active years in the international Go scene spanned
            from 1992 to 2012, with the period from 1996 to 2006 being
            recognized as the "Lee Changho era" in the Go world. Throughout his
            professional career, Lee has won 17 world championships and 21
            international tournament titles, still holding the world number one
            ranking. Lee Changho is not only a champion in individual
            competitions but also a hero in team competitions. With his
            unwavering determination, he achieved 14 consecutive victories in
            the Three Nations Cup, ended the match 9 times, with a total record
            of 29 wins and 7 losses. He is revered by South Korean Go fans as
            the "guardian deity" and is known as the "Iron Gate" by Go
            enthusiasts in China and Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lee Changho, along with Cao Xunxuan, Xu Fengzhu, and Liu Changhe,
            are known as the "Four Heavenly Kings" of South Korea. Meanwhile,
            Lee Sedol, Park Yeonghun, and Choi Cheolhan are regarded as the "New
            Four Heavenly Kings." Due to similarities in age, pronunciation of
            names, domestic achievements, and playing style with China's Chang
            Hao, both Lee Changho and Chang Hao are referred to as the "Peerless
            Pair." However, in terms of international achievements and
            head-to-head records, Chang Hao falls behind significantly.

          <h4>Lee Sedol</h4>
          <h5>
            Lee Sedol (Korean: 이세돌, born March 2, 1983) is a South Korean Go
            player holding the rank of 9-dan. He grew up in Byeokje Island,
            Sinan County, South Jeolla Province, South Korea, earning him the
            nickname "Boy from Byeokje Island." He is also known as the
            "Invincible Boy" due to his impressive early career performances in
            domestic competitions in South Korea. Lee Sedol is considered the
            third-generation master of Go in South Korea. Alongside Lee Changho,
            he is referred to as "Big and Small Lee." Together with Lee Changho,
            Park Yeonghun, and Choi Cheolhan, Lee Sedol is recognized as one of
            the "New Four Heavenly Kings" of South Korea. He is also compared to
            China's Gu Li, being called the "Peerless Pair." Throughout his
            career, Lee Sedol has won 14 world championships and 18
            international tournament titles, second only to Lee Changho, making
            him one of the most successful Go players in history. His peak
            performance was from 2002 to 2012.
          </h5>
          <p>
            In his early career, Lee Sedol's playing style was sharp and
            aggressive, excelling in large-scale attacks, earning him the
            nickname "Fourteen-dan" in the middle game, but his opening moves
            were relatively weak. As he matured and his skills developed, he
            transformed into a versatile player, capable of both offense and
            defense, becoming a master of the Go world. His playing style became
            subtle and deceptive, often employing cunning moves and displaying
            precise calculation. He would frequently sacrifice large groups of
            stones in the opening, only to resurrect them later using various
            strategic maneuvers, a style affectionately known as the "zombie
            flow" among Go enthusiasts. Lee Sedol also possessed exceptional
            psychological resilience, often turning the tables and clinching
            victory even when trailing in world championship matches. From 2005
            to 2010, he engaged in multiple showdowns with China's Gu Li,
            drawing significant attention from the Go community as their match
            records remained evenly matched, establishing them as
            contemporaneous rivals. In 2016, Lee Sedol faced off against
            Google's AlphaGo AI software in a historic five-game match. Although
            he ultimately lost the series 1-4, his victory in one game
            demonstrated that humans still possessed the potential to defeat
            computers in the game of Go.
